I am a postdoctoral researcher at [DASYA](https://dasya.itu.dk/) group in **IT University of Copenhagen**. I am working on the project “Making Metadata Count" with [Veronika Cheplygina](https://veronikach.com/). With this project we aim to investigate meta-data-aware methods to try to avoid learning biases or shortcuts, as well as, research fairness metrics for patient subgroups, such as age, sex or ethnicity, to investigate the equity of the algorithm. We are organizing a webinar series: [Datasets through the L👀king-Glass](https://purrlab.github.io/webinar/) to better understand what are researchers doing with their (meta-) data. Stay tuned!

I graduated with a dissertation in **learning representations for medical image diagnosis** at the **Pompeu Fabra University**. I was part of the [BCN MedTech](https://www.upf.edu/web/bcn-medtech/) group and my PhD thesis was supervised by [Gemma Piella](https://www.upf.edu/web/simbiosys/entry/-/-/37215/adscripcion/gemma-piella) and [Diana Mateus]() (Ecole Centrale Nantes). During this time, I was an [INPhINIT](https://fundacionlacaixa.org/en/inphinit-doctoral-fellowships-call) fellow funded by “La Caixa” foundation and EU Horizon 2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie programme. I hold a degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the **University of Granada** and a Master of Science in Biomedical Computing from the **Technical University of Munich**. During my master’s studies I was a research assistant at the Rechts der Isar Hospital of Munich.

Though I enjoy the maths side of my work, I like getting out of the research bubble to **[disseminate](https://ameliajimenez.github.io/outreach/)** research to the general public. Dissemination is also an opportunity to break with **gender stereotypes**, give **visibility to diverse role models** and **empower** young girls to pursue scientific and technologic careers. With this aim I have contributed, with my two cents, in several **volunteering activities**.

In my free time, I enjoy going to the **cinema and concerts, reading, cooking and playing board games**. I probably spend most of my free time **traveling** and doing **[sports](https://www.strava.com/athletes/80615838)**. I’m fond of team sports: handball, soccer, beach volleyball, etc. I love being surrounded by nature, I enjoy going to the **mountains** and just staring at natural landscapes. I’m an active **hiker and cycler**. My passion for **music** is a bit controversial, I don’t have any musical education but love all kinds of rhythms. I’ve just started to learn the box, let’s see how it goes.
