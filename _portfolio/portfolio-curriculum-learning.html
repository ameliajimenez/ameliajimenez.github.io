<p>In a typical educational system, learning relies on a <strong>curriculum</strong> that introduces new concepts building upon previously acquired ones. The rationale behind, is that humans and animals learn better when information is presented in a meaningful way rather than randomly. We follow this starting small concept to design our approaches with convolutional neural networks for medical image classification tasks. </p>

<p> I developed a <b>novel curriculum learning (CL) strategy</b> to improve femur fracture classification from X-rays <b>[JA19]</b>, showing that training sample order significantly impacts model performance, especially in medical contexts where domain knowledge is key. By integrating <b>domain knowledge</b> from medical guidelines, expert annotations, and ambiguities in their annotations, I improved model reliability and classification accuracy. I further extended this work into a comprehensive CL framework with three strategies: sample weighting, training set ordering, and subset sampling <b>[JA22]</b>. Additionally, I showed that <b>model uncertainty</b> can serve as a fallback when domain knowledge is unavailable.

<p> To culminate this line of research, I designed a <b>federated learning (FL) framework</b> that integrates CL and unsupervised domain adaptation to improve breast cancer classification across multi-centers datasets <b>[JA23a]</b>. FL offers a secure and privacy preserving method to train a ML algorithm across multiple decentralized nodes that keep their data samples locally. In this setting, local models perform computation on their private data to update the global model. Our CL approach utilized a <b>data scheduler</b> to prioritize local training samples, with the objective of reinforcing local model consistency by penalizing forgotten samples.
