<p> The availability of large public datasets and increased computing power have shifted the medical imaging community's focus to high-performance algorithms. However, <b>data quality and annotations</b> receive little attention. While ML has shown promising results in medical image diagnosis, often claiming expert-level performance, many algorithms are still hindered by issues such as <b>bias and shortcuts</b>. Bias primarily impacts underrepresented demographic groups based on factors such as gender or race. Shortcuts refer to spurious correlations between artifacts in images and diagnostic labels. To address this, I proposed methods for <b>detecting shortcut learning</b> and compiled a glossary of terms to help researchers navigate the literature <b>[JA23b]</b>. I conducted systematic experiments on two publicly available chest X-ray datasets that demonstrate performance degradation when images with drains are excluded. Building on this, with colleagues at ITU, we enhance two publicly available chest X-ray datasets by adding non-expert annotations of chest tubes <b>[CV25]</b>, using a <b>crowdsourcing</b> approach where data science students (non-medical experts) performed the annotations. As an output, we created the <b>Non-Expert Annotations of Tubes in X-rays (NEATX) dataset</b>. Further work on eye fundus images revealed models relying on irrelevant regions <b>[ST25]</b>. Our analysis extends beyond performance metrics, using the <b>SHAP explainability</b> method and <b>embedding analysis</b> to better understand model behavior.
